Plan for the Project:
✅ Data Collection: Gather datasets containing real and fake news articles with both text and images. (e.g., LIAR, FakeNewsNet)
✅ Preprocessing: Clean the text using NLP techniques and extract features from images.
✅ Model Architecture: Use a hybrid model combining Transformers (e.g., BERT) for text and CNNs for images.
✅ Training & Evaluation: Train on a labeled dataset, fine-tune hyperparameters, and evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score.
✅ Deployment: Create a Flask/FastAPI-based web app to allow users to check the authenticity of news articles.

Please Check the code in the file section.


The code sets up the dataset pipeline for Multimodal AI for Fake News Detection by:

Loading a dataset containing both text and images.
Tokenizing text using BERT.
Processing images using PyTorch transforms.
Creating a custom PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader.
Next Steps:
✅ Build the Multimodal Model (BERT + CNN).
✅ Train the model on the dataset.
✅ Evaluate performance.
✅ Deploy a simple API or Web App.
